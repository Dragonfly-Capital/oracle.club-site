	"About": "The decentralized lending platform Compound uses a custom application-specific price oracle.\nCompoundâ€™s oracle relies on a single, centralized poster (price gathering script) to pull the price of a basket of assets relative to Ether from many different exchange sources. This trusted party then posts price updates to the blockchain each time it detects a 1% deviation in price. The newly reported price must be within a 10% bound of an anchor price that is updated every hour. Large price movements (>10%) must be set manually using a corresponding, specific hardware key. This key is currently controlled by the Compound team.\nCompound has also developed a second oracle design they call the Compound Open Oracle System. Using the Open Oracle system, anyone wishing to report a price can do so. This report is then propagated via a p2p network to all other nodes in the system. Anyone with gas and a connection to the Ethereum network can then post the signed price data on-chain. A single on-chain contract, known as the Data Contract, is responsible for holding and validating all price data. This contract sorts the reported information by price reporter. Any on-chain application can request to view price data by selecting a subset of the reported price feeds. While Compound expects to productionize this oracle in the near future (still completing audits), it has yet to be launched on the Ethereum mainnet.",
